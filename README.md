# Learning Projects

This repo collects my training apps in one place. Each app sits in its own folder inside this directory. I focus on clean, simple, and well documented code.

## Structure
- `practice-todo-app`: Daily task practice app.
- More folders will appear as I add new apps.

## Workflow
1. Create a new folder for every app under this root directory.
2. Build and test inside that folder.
3. Return to this root to run `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

## Goals
- Keep every project small and focused.
- Practice readable code and clear comments.
- Learn by shipping small features often.
